## RunTimePrediction ##
=================

This is a Run Time Prediction algorithm that based on the paper:

Smith, W., Foster, I., and Taylor, V. Predicting application run times using historical
information. In Lecture Notes on Computer Science (1998).

This paper present a novel grouping algorithm that groups similar jobs for run time prediction. The
algorithm assumes that similar jobs in the same category will provide similar task run time.

The code is implemented in C++.
